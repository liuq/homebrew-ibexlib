# homebrew-ibexlib
A repository for building the ibex library with the java plugin (so to be used with Choco).

Indeed, homebrew-core/ibex is not creating the java library because core formulae cannot have optional dependencies.

The purpose of this repository is to overcome this limit, having a ibex library with java support to be used with Choco.
